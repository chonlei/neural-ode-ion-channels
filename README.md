To re-run and create the main figures, use:
- Figure 2: `[figure-1.py](figure-1.py)`
- Figure 3: `[figure-2.py](figure-2.py)`
- Figure 4: `[figure-3.py](figure-3.py)`
- Figure 5: `[figure-4.py](figure-4.py)`
- Figure 6: `[figure-5.py](figure-5.py)`
- Figure 7: `[figure-6.py](figure-6.py)`.

These generate figures in directories `figure-1`, `figure-2`, etc.
